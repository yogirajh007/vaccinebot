First, create a bot using *@BotFather* on telegram. A **token** will be generated.

Run these commands:

pip install pyTelegramBotAPI


Run getcid.py by replacing the token generated by BotFather. While getcid.py is running, open a chat with your **newly created bot** and type /getcid. An integer will be returned from the bot. That integer is the **cid**.


Replace cid and Token in yourbot.py
Replace line 79 in yourbot.py with desired pincodes

Keep the script running in backgroup by running:

```console
foo@bar:~$ nohup python3 yourbot.py &
```
