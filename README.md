# YAVB - Yet Another Vaccine Bot
## _Get notification when vaccine slots are available_



YAVB is a telegram bot, which notifies you, when a slot your area becomes available for vaccination.

- Uses official CoWIN APIs
- Real Time Data

First, create a bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on telegram. A **token** will be generated.

Run these commands:

```console
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
```

Run getcid.py by replacing the token generated by BotFather. While getcid.py is running, open a chat with your **newly created bot** and type "/getcid". An integer will be returned from the bot. That integer is the **cid**.


Replace cid and Token in yourbot.py
Replace line 74 in yourbot.py with desired PINCODES.

Keep the script running in backgroup by running:

```console
foo@bar:~$ nohup python3 yourbot.py &
```
