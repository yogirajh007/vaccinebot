# YAVB - Yet Another Vaccine Bot
## _Get notification when vaccine slots are available_



YAVB is a telegram bot, which notifies you, when a slot your area becomes available for vaccination.

- Uses official CoWIN APIs
- Real Time Data

First, clone the repo and create a bot using [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather) on telegram. A **token** will be generated.

Run these commands on your pc with internet connection:

```console
pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
```
After that:

1. Run getcid.py by replacing the token generated by BotFather. 

2. While getcid.py is running, open a chat with your **newly created bot** and type "/getcid". An integer will be returned from the bot. That integer is the **cid**.
3. Replace **cid** and **Token** in yourbot.py. Replace line 74 in yourbot.py with desired PINCODES.

4. Keep the script running in background by running:

```console
foo@bar:~$ nohup python3 yourbot.py &
```

To kill the bot,

```console
foo@bar:~$ pkill -f yourbot
```

As the script needs to be running for getting notification, you can add a cron-job or can start and stop the script manually. Usually the slots are created in the evening after 5-6PM IST
